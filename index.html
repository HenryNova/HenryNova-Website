        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administration - Supply Chain Management</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Henry Nova, and I am a first-year student studying Business Administration at the University of California, Riverside.  I am eighteen years old, and I was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA, but I currently reside in Riverside, CA.  My primary goals in college are to obtain the necessary skills I need to succeed in my future career, and to gain connections and network with both professors and my fellow students in the Business program.  In addition, after I obtain my bachelor’s degree in business administration, I plan to apply to graduate school where I will get my master’s degree in business administration.<br><br>

        Being a first-year student, I admittedly do not have much professional experience.  However, I plan to gain this professional experience during my time at college.  For my first two years of college, I will complete all the necessary prerequisites, which include breadth courses and lower-division business courses, that are required for me to enter into UC Riverside’s School of Business Administration, or SOBA for short.  Upon admission into the School of Business Administration, I will have to choose a Business concentration.  At the moment, I am very interested in the supply chain management concentration; I am fascinated by the supply chain and how goods are produced, how they move from one point to another point, and how the products are sold to consumers all around the world.  I want to work in the supply chain management and logistics field because I believe I will learn invaluable skills in the industry, such as communication, analytics, and problem solving.  Additionally, I want to have the ability to make an impact every day I come into work and see the results across many areas of the company.  Because I am interested in the supply chain management concentration, I plan to get an internship that focuses on logistics as a whole.<br><br>

        Through this internship, I will gain the skills and knowledge I need to ensure success in my future career in supply chain management.  In addition, this internship will also boost my chances of getting into graduate school, where I will focus on getting a degree with a concentration in supply chain management.  I plan to get my master’s degree in business administration with a specialization in supply chain management.  I believe getting an MBA will not only help me better understand the supply chain management and logistics industry, but also help me work my way up the ladder in a certain company.  I want to be able to take a leadership role in a company because not only would I like to earn a higher salary, but I would also like to earn the respect of my colleagues.  Therefore, through graduate school and a master’s degree, I will hopefully achieve my future goals.
